# NCS-Lab-and-Silo-Mosaic-UniCAVE
My graduate level project which saw me working under Professore Arie Kaufman to help in developing a program which increased performance on the Silo virtual reality system.

This repository contains both the Unity project and batch files needed to run the system on both a 6-Screen and 32-Screen setup. It also contains the paper and presentation materials related to the project.
